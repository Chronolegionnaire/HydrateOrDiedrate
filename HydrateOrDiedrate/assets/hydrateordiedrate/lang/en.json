  "hydrateordiedrate:survivalinfo-thirst-text": "<strong>Thirst</strong><br><i>Feeling parched? Your survival now depends on more than just food!</i><br><br>The <strong>Thirst Mechanic</strong> adds a new survival challenge to your adventures. Stay hydrated or face the consequences!<br><br><strong>Thirst Bar:</strong> Keep an eye on your thirst bar, which gradually depletes over time. Hot climates cause thirst to drain even faster, so manage your hydration carefully when traveling to the south!<br><br><strong>Weather Influence:</strong> Hot temperatures cause faster thirst depletion. Wear cooling clothes or seek shelter to help slow down the drain. Being wet also helps cool you down, and sometimes wearing less clothing can be the better option.<br><br><strong>DEATH:</strong> Failing to stay hydrated will result in death—and quickly! Thirst damage is approximately double that of starvation.<br><br><strong>Liquid Encumbrance:</strong> Carrying more than 4 (default) litres of liquid in a container will slow down your movement. Plan your liquid storage wisely.<br><br><strong>Hydration from Food & Drinks:</strong> Every food and drink item now has a hydration stat. Special items like soups and juices will temporarily pause thirst, while alcohol provides an even longer reprieve, thanks to the unique way Seraphs process it.<br><br><strong>Water Sources:</strong> Drink directly from water sources by holding down <hk>shift</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> on a liquid block. However, drinking this way increases hunger, so processing drinks or making soups is a more efficient method of hydration. Saltwater is extremely unsafe to drink, so be careful when sourcing water from the wild.<br><br><strong>Rain Water Collection:</strong> All liquid containers can now collect rainwater when placed outside during a storm. Rainwater is a great early to mid-game resource as it replenishes more thirst and reduces hunger at half the rate of regular water.<br><br><strong>Kegs:</strong> You can craft <a href=\"handbook://block-hydrateordiedrate:keg\">Kegs</a> from wood, sticks, and iron hoops. Initially untapped, they are used for long-term liquid storage. To tap a keg, forge a <a href=\"handbook://item-hydrateordiedrate:kegtap\">Keg Tap</a> from <a href=\"handbook://item-ingot-brass\">Brass</a> and hammer it into place with the tap in hand and a hammer in your off-hand (Hold <hk>rightmouse</hk>). This allows you to both add and remove liquids from the keg. Remember, kegs can be recycled with an axe (Hold <hk>rightmouse</hk>), though there’s a chance some metal may be lost in the process.<br><br><strong>Nutrition Deficit:</strong> Be mindful of liquids with negative saturation values, as they can cause a <strong>Nutrition Deficit</strong>, shown as an orange marker on your saturation bar. While you have any nutrition deficit, food will not provide any nutrition. Every bit of satiation you consume will gradually reduce the deficit until it reaches zero.<br><br><strong>Wells:</strong> Establish wells to secure a steady supply of water. Their efficiency is influenced by natural aquifers, which are typically stronger near water and hot springs. For a detailed explanation on well construction and management, visit <a href=\"handbook://hydrateordiedrate:wellinfo\">Wells</a>.",
